# CHIP-8 polyglot project

Implement a full featured CHIP-8 interpreter in various programming languages and technologies, as a learning exercice.

## Expectations

For each language / technology included in "implementations", the interpreter have to :

- handle every CHIP-8, SUPER-CHIP and XO-CHIP instructions
- implement all various configurable quirks
- successfully pass every test cartridge

The code should be clear, documented, and as idiomatic as possible.
CI should be setup, with automatic tests, lint and formatting.

## Available implementations

- Python

## Missing implementations on the roadmap

- Go
- Rust
- TypeScript / Browser
- GdScript / Godot Engine 4 
- C# / MonoGame (?)
- Swift
